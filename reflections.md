##Reflections

#For most of Bandit challenges they were initially confusing, but figuring them out and solving them made me aware of security concepts I didn't know about.

#I had to experiment with each level and I used the suggested links and command the game provided while also looking through google when I needed a little more help.

#While going through the challenges I felt like a hacker going through someone elses files and I realized that this must be what actual hackers must do when navigating other people data. The hidden files level definitely through me for a loop also, but it helped me realized that this is a way to defend aganist hackers.

#Even though I was able to solve the levels without any guidance, I do recognize the importance of continued practice to reinforce these skills and to achieve a long term confidence.
